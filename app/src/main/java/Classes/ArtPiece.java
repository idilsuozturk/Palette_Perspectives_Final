/*
    In this abstract class, we will save attributes of an art piece like the
price of an art piece, name of the art and artist, owner of the art piece, photo availability, and
whether an offer is possible. It also includes a few methods for changing price, name, owner,
etc. (setters and getters). Moreover, there will be a method for offering new price. This class
will be the superclass of the Digital Art Piece and Hardcopy Art Piece classes.
